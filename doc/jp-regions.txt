~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These files contain the list of administrative divisions (行政区画) in
Japan.  File |jp-regions-full.json| contain more properties than file

* Structure

These files contain an "area list" JSON object containing 47
prefectures (都道府県) in Japan.

The |areas| fields of the "area list" objects of prefectures contain
"area list" objects of cities (including wards in Tokyo), districts,
and towns and villages (市区郡町村) not belonging to any other
district in the prefecture.

The |areas| fields of the "area list" objects of designated cities
(政令指定都市) contain "area list" objects of wards (区) in the city.

The |areas| fields of the "area list" object of districts (郡) contain
"area list" objects of towns and villages (町村) in the district.

Note that districts (郡) in Hokkaidou prefecture (北海道) are not
contained in |areas| field, but in |districts| field of the
prefecture's area object.

* The "area list" JSON object structure

The "area list" object is a JSON object, where names are Japanese
names of the areas and values are their data.

As exceptions, there are five district entries in the 北海道
prefecture which contain district names followed by country (令制国)
names in parentheses to avoid name confliction:

  上川郡 (十勝国)
  上川郡 (天塩国)
  上川郡 (石狩国)
  中川郡 (天塩国)
  中川郡 (十勝国)
