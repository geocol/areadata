and towns and villages (市区郡町村) not belonging to any other
district in the prefecture.

(政令指定都市) contain "area list" objects of wards (区) in the city.

The |areas| fields of the "area list" object of districts (郡) contain
"area list" objects of towns and villages (町村) in the district.

contained in |areas| field, but in |districts| field of the

a JSON object where names are region IDs (value of |id| fields of area
objects as described later) and values are corresponding area objects.

names of the areas and values are their data.
