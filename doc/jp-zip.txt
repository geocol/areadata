~~~~~~~~~~~

This file contains Japanese ZIP code data.

* Structure

The file contains a JSON object, where names are ZIP codes and values
are their descriptions.

This file contains area-based ZIP code only.  It does not contain ZIP
codes assigned with specific organizations or offices.

Values are JSON arrays, containing area objects with which ZIP codes
are assigned.

Area objects are JSON objects with following name/value pairs:

  area [string]

    The 5-digits 全国地方公共団体コード of the city, town, or village
    to which the area belongs.  See also |jp-regions.json|.

  banchi [string?]

    The 番地 or the range of 番地, optionally followed by 号.

  building_level [(number or string)?]

    If specified, the floor in the building to which the ZIP code is
    assigned.  The value |1| represents the first (ground) floor.  The
    value |fallback| represents that the ZIP code should be used for
    underground floors and when floor is unknown.

  choume [string?]

    The 丁目 or the range of 丁目.

  has_building_codes_in_town [boolean]

    If true, there are building-specific ZIP codes assigned to
    buildings in the area.

  has_choume [boolean]

    Whether there are 丁目 in the area, according to Japan Post's ZIP
    code data.

  koaza [string?]

    The subarea name in the |town|'s area.  Typically it is a 小字,
    but might include other addressing or complex annotations in the
    Japan Post's ZIP code data.

  koaza_addressed_town [boolean]

    小字毎に番地が起番されている町域 field in the Japan Post's ZIP
    code data.

  koaza_fallback [boolean]

    If true, it represents the subarea that are not covered by any
    other subarea in |town|'s area.

  koaza_kana [string?]

    Katakana representation of |koaza|.

  multiple_codes_per_town [boolean]

    一町域が二以上の郵便番号で表される場合 field in the Japan Post's
    ZIP code data.

  no_choume [boolean]

    If true, the area does not contain area where 丁目 is assigned,
    but contains 番地 addressed area.

  street_addr [string?]

    Street-based address component used in Kyoto city area.

  street_addr_kana [string?]

    Katakana representation of |street_addr|.

  town [string?]

    The area name in the city, town, or village.  Typically it is a 大
    字 or equivalent.

  town_kana [string?]

    Katakana representation of |town|.

  town_fallback [boolean]

    other subarea in |area|'s area.

  zip_old [string]

    The obsolete 3- or 5-digits ZIP code for the area.

* Constructing an address

An address string can be constructed from an area object by
concatenating following substrings in order:

  1. A prefecture name followed by a city, town, or village name,
     optionally followed by a ward name, obtained from |area|.

  2. |town|, if any.

  3. |street_addr|, if any.

  4. |koaza|, if any.  (If it is an annotation, replace it by actual
     area name.)

  5. |choume|, if any.  (If it is a range, replace it by actual value.)

  6. |banchi|, if any.  (If it is a range, replace it by actual value.)

  7. |building_level| followed by |階|, if any and its value is not
     |fallback|.

If you want to contruct an address string of areas in the data that
can be distinguished each other (e.g. to create a ZIP code search
form), you should also add some annotation based on |town_fallback|,
|koaza_fallback|, |has_choume|, |no_choume|, |building_level|'s value
|fallback|, and ranges or annotations in |koaza|, |choume|, and
|banchi|.
